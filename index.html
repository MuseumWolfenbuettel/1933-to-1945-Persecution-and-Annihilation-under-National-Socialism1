            The first raising of the swastika flag at the town market on March 3, 1933, symbolized the Nazis' conquest of public space. The establishment of the Nazi dictatorship quickly became evident through the brutal persecution of political opponents, particularly those from the labor movement, and its radical antisemitism. The Nazi-propagated "Volksgemeinschaft" (national community) was built on a racist foundation that rewarded "Aryan comrades" while excluding Jews, Sinti and Roma, homosexuals, and dissenters.
During their consolidation of power, the Nazis brutally targeted political opponents, including Social Democrats, Communists, and trade unionists. In March and April 1933 alone, at least 35 individuals were placed in "protective custody," a police measure used to suppress political opposition by detaining individuals indefinitely without judicial approval.
On the night of July 6-7, 1933, SS men, appointed as auxiliary police, arrested 15 Communist residents of Wolfenbüttel and tortured them for hours in the NSDAP district headquarters on Mühlenstraße under the supervision of district leader Herbert Lehmann. Alfred Perkampus died that night. The following morning, the detainees and Perkampus’s body were transported to Braunschweig’s AOK building in a truck. Fritz Fischer and Alfred Müller were killed later that morning, and their bodies were buried in secret in the Lappwald forest near Helmstedt.
The persecution of Jews also began in 1933. After the nationwide boycott of Jewish businesses on April 1, 1933, Jewish citizens faced increasing social and economic exclusion. The arson attack on the Wolfenbüttel synagogue on November 9, 1938, during Kristallnacht, and the temporary imprisonment of Wolfenbüttel’s Jewish residents in the Buchenwald concentration camp, accelerated their forced emigration.
During the war years after 1939, anti-Jewish measures intensified. Isolation in so-called "Jewish houses" was followed by deportations to the Warsaw Ghetto, Auschwitz, and Theresienstadt. At least 40 residents of Wolfenbüttel who were deported in 1942 and 1943 became victims of the Nazi extermination policies.
Political dissenters and foreign forced laborers employed in local industries increasingly became targets of Nazi persecution during the Second World War. Charges of "work refusal," "undermining military morale," listening to forbidden enemy radio broadcasts, or alleged "looting" led to trials before the Special Court in Braunschweig or the People’s Court in Berlin, often resulting in draconian sentences, including the death penalty.
The Nazi regime was finally brought to an end with the arrival of American troops on April 11, 1945.
